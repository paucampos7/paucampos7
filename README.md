Hi everyone!
My name is Paula. I'm a Teacher and Textile Design graduate. I specialize in graphic design, visual communication, and digital content for education and websites.
I use creativity, precision, and empathy to create materials that inform, connect, and have impact.
I'm also passionate about front-end development. I enjoy bringing designs to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating user-friendly interfaces that look great and are easy for everyone to use.
